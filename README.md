The following is an example on the usage of Solr for indexing tweets, the project uses python scripts to collect and preprocess some of the structure of twitter response, as well as some configuration in solr that allows to do some processing based on language detection, date and geolocation. It is a nice exercise to try to index information and use solr query techniques to quickly fetch it back based on documents index.
